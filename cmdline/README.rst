The CmdLine Library
===================

Introduction
------------

This library assists with reading parameters from the command line.
It supports different types of arguments, including floating point numbers, integers, and booleans.
Moreover, it automatically generates a ``--help`` flag that provides custom information about the available flags.

Tutorial
--------

To use this library, you only need to familiarize yourself with a single class.
This class is called ``CommandLineOptionParser``.
It's in the namespace ``ae108::cmdline``.

Example Application
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let's try using this class in a simple example.

.. code-block:: cpp

    #include <ae108/cmdline/CommandLineOptionParser.h>
    #include <iostream>

    int main(const int argc, const char *const *const argv) {
        /**
         * @todo use command line options
         */
    }

Construction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

To parse the command line parameters, we'll construct a ``CommandLineOptionParser`` by providing a stream.
Let's say we want to print error messages and warnings to ``stderr``.

.. code-block:: cpp

    namespace cmdline = ae108::cmdline;
    cmdline::CommandLineOptionParser(std::cerr)
        /**
         * @todo define available options
         */
        ;

Adding Options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The only thing that is missing are the options that we would like to parse.
In this example, we are going greet the world if greetings are enabled via a command line flag.
The ``CommandLineOptionParser`` class provides a ``withOption`` method that we are going to use to achieve that.

In this example we'll add a flag ``--enable_greeting`` (with a short form ``-g``) together with a help text describing the flag.

.. code-block:: cpp

    auto enable_greeting = bool{false};
    cmdline::CommandLineOptionParser(std::cerr)
        .withOption("enable_greeting,g", "Print a greeting.", &enable_greeting)
        .parse(argc, argv);

    if (enable_greeting) {
        std::cout << "Hello world!" << std::endl;
    }

Let's see it in action.

.. code-block:: shell-session

    $ cmdline/examples/ae108-CmdLineExample
    $ cmdline/examples/ae108-CmdLineExample --enable_greeting=yes
    Hello world!
    $ cmdline/examples/ae108-CmdLineExample --enable_greeting=no
    $ cmdline/examples/ae108-CmdLineExample -g yes
    Hello world!

As promised, there's also a ``--help`` flag:

.. code-block:: shell-session

    $ cmdline/examples/ae108-CmdLineExample --help
    Command line options:
    -h [ --help ]                Show this help.
    -g [ --enable_greeting ] arg Print a greeting.

Moreover, a warning message is printed out to ``stderr`` if an unknown flag is used.

.. code-block:: shell-session

    $ cmdline/examples/ae108-CmdLineExample --unknown_flag=123
    Warning: The following options were not recognized by cmdline: '--unknown_flag=123'.

Most importantly, invalid command line parameters are rejected with a suitable error message.

.. code-block:: shell-session

    $ cmdline/examples/ae108-CmdLineExample --enable_greeting=123
    the argument ('123') for option '--enable_greeting' is invalid. Valid choices are 'on|off', 'yes|no', '1|0' and 'true|false'

Example Source Code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The full source code of the example is available in ``cmdline/examples/Example.cc``.
If you want to build it and try it out, then compile the executable target ``ae108-CmdLineExample`` and run it with command line options of your choice.

Outlook
-------

We've seen many of the features in action, but there's a bit more to explore.
For instance, it's possible to chain more than one call to ``withOption``:

.. code-block:: cpp

    cmdline::CommandLineOptionParser(std::cerr)
        .withOption(/* ... */)
        .withOption(/* ... */)
        .parse(argc, argv);

Also, there is another overload of ``withOption`` that permits to add flags without a help text.

You can find additional information in the API documentation of the library.

.. toctree::

    cmdline-src.rst

In addition, the tests in ``cmdline/test/CommandLineOptionParser_Test.cc`` showcase the features in common use cases.
