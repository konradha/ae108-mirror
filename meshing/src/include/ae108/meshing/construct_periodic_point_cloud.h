/**
 * @brief Returns a vector of points that is spanned by a set of discrete
 * translations around the origin. It is also known as Bravais lattice.
 *
 * In 3D, each point is defined by
 *
 *          R = n1 x a1 + n2 x a2 + n3 x a3,
 *
 * where ai is a translation vector and ni assumes any of the integers in set.
 *
 * @param translations An array containing the translation vectors.
 * @param origin Location of the origin.
 * @param set A set of integer permutations
 * @note https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bravais_lattice
